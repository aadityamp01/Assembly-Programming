// PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write X86/64 ALP to perform non-overlapped block transfer without 
// string specific instructions. Block containing data can be defined in the data segment.


ALGORITHM
Non-overlapped mode
1. Initialize 2 memory blocks pointed by source and destination registers.
2. Initialize counter.
3. Move the contents pointed by source register to a register.
4. Increment address of source register.
5. Move the contents from register into location pointed by destination register.
6. Increment destination registers.
7. Decrement counter.
8. Repeat from steps 3 to step 6 until counter is 0.
9. End.


// Input Format

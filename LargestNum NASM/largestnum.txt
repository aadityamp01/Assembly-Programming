PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write an x86/64 ALP to find largest of given BYTE/WORD/DWORD/ 64-bit numbers

ALGORITHM:
1.	Declare array with numbers (input)
2.	Take variable for counter
3.	Assign rsi to array to get current number
4.	assign 0 value to al register
5.	compare value of al register with value pointed by rsi in array (Mov al.[rsi])
6.	If number of rsi  is less than al, then perform exchange operation
7.	otherwise increment rsi and compare again with al
8.	continue above comparison until counter becomes zero
9.	largest number store in al
10.	call display procedure to display largest number
